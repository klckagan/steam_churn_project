ðŸŽ® Steam Churn Prediction with Deep Learning

This project analyzes player behavior in digital games and predicts churn (player dropout) using monthly statistics from SteamCharts. The solution is powered by a Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained on engineered features and interpreted with SHAP explainability.

ðŸ“Š Model Architecture

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=6, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.3))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(16, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
